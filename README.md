Note: The only shape file I could find for judicial districts, came from here, for reference:  
https://onedrive.live.com/?id=C754C68262A316DC%21109&cid=C754C68262A316DC   
It exceeds gh's file limits. It's uploaded to my carto acct. 
It was not used in the piece as the data didn't benefit from a geo visualization; However, we did create a mapping just merging county
geom's as the judicial district names in the data file did match the map file and we used FIPS codes to map to Census data instead.
